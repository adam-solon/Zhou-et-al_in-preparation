The code contained in this repository provides scripts for analyses contained in the manuscript:

Zhou et al. (in preparation). Seasonal processes in high Arctic deglaciated soils: characterization and microbial-biogeochemical modelling.

Two analyses, saved as R markdown files, are located in subdirectories: 

1) biogeochemistry which computes summary statistics for soil measurements of microbial cell counts, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total sulfur, nitrate, phosphate, and sulfate.

2) bacterial_communities which computes relative abundances of 16S SSU rRNA gene amplicons and displays those values in stacked bar graphs. 

These analyses are one component (characterization) of the overall study modelling seasonal processes of soils at different stages of succession in a glacial forefield on the Archipelago of Svalbard.
